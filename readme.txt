PTimer is a very small and easy but flexible timer library.

It is written in pure C and consists of one header and one .C source file only.

It supports both periodic and single-shot timers.

All timers have a custom parameter for their callbacks.

All timers can change their callback, callback argument and timeout,
even if they are active and running.

PTimer is built on top of PThreads library, that is the only needed thing.

You can look at example and doxygen-generated documentation.

Happy timers!
